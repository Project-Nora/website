<a class="big">Several</a> years have passed, Nora is now 16 years old.
She has grown into a beautiful girl, she also started her magical training from her school which is not that far from her hometown.
Nora still remembers the day how her younger sister, Tamoe, helped her get away from the danger and lost herself in the process into the darkness.
She never gives up on getting stronger but need time for it. <br /> <br />

<a style="margin-left: 20px;">Nora</a> joined a magical school, which bared the name of [ <b>Astral Magical High School</b> ] to learn more about magic that can help her rescue her younger sister.
She needed some preparation before going into the school.
She knows this because of her time growing up, her parents didn't even care about her.
Only thing on their mind was their own career and getting praises from the Townlord. <br />

<a style="margin-left: 20px;">Nora</a> then, started to package her daily stuff, clothes, tools, the works, into her luggage.
She also wrote a letter about going to the magical high school to her parents, she didn't give them but put it on the table.
Once she put the letter on the table, she took her luggage and started heading out. <br />

<a style="margin-left: 20px">There</a> was a man with an old hoodie standing in front of her house.
He has a katana handle around his waist. From the looks of it, this is not an ordinary person, it's like a man with a skillful melee attack.
For the first time, Nora sees an adult who can fully kill anyone with his katana but doesn't feel any magic flow around him. <br />

He is just standing in front of her. Nora, understandably, was afraid, thinking this is the person who tried to kill her in the forest. <br />
The man then, started to speak:
<div class="story-middle">
    <i>
        Are you Nora? <br />
        I'm a traveler from another town.
        Just having my little break around here for some lunch. <br />
        Also what's with the getup, you're going anywhere?
    </i>
</div>

Nora replied:
<div class="story-middle">
    Yeah, my name is Nora. How do you know my name? <br />
    Have we met before or—
</div>
—something stopped her from continuing speaking.

The man didn't say anything, just waving his hand by replying no. <br />
<a style="margin-left: 20px;">She</a> was shocked and started to self defense, if the man come closer. <br />
The man laughed a bit and said:
<div class='story-middle'>
    <i>
        Haha you're a funny one, you know that. <br />
        Well, this is not the place for chatting, let's move towards the front gate of the town. <br />
        They are selling some food that I like, and you know what, I'll buy you some also.
    </i>
</div>

Nora, lowered her guard, and follows the man. <br />
She then, said:
<div class='story-middle'>
    <i>I'm going to 「Astral Magical High School」, how about you? <br />
        Also, you still didn't tell me your name.
    </i>
</div>

The man replied:
<div class='story-middle'>
    「Astral Magical High School」… <br />
    <i>
        Oh sorry for that, you can just call me ‘ Chaos ’. <br />
        It's my nickname anyway. I can take you there.
    </i>
</div>

Nora nodded and followed Chaos to the front gate.</p>

<a style="color: gray;opacity: 0.5;font-size: 1rem;"> (redz: parts after this is just a direct copypaste from the source) </a>

<p lang="en" class="western" style="line-height: 130%; margin-top: 0.14in; margin-bottom: 0in">
    When they reach the food stall, Nora can't hide her saliva dripping
    down while watching the tasty food. Chaos noticed and said: &quot;
    Are you hungry? Your saliva.. It will ruin your beauty image in front
    of other people &quot; She noticed and quickly replied: &quot; No I'm
    not! hmph.. &quot; her stomach is growling. She immediately became
    quiet and felt very embarrassed. Chaos buys some food and gives it to
    Nora. Nora says thanks and starts having her lunch with Chaos. Her
    smile so sweet when even she is eating, <i>what a beauty</i> <i>*haha*.</i>
    After having some delicious meals, Nora is ready to move on to the
    Magical School. They move to the front gate of the town, Chaos makes
    a small whisper and there is a horse running towards them. He invites
    her to join the ride while going to the Magical School. Nora is
    excited and accepts Chaos' invitation for the ride. Once Nora hopped
    on the horse and they left the town. While on the ride, Nora tries to
    ask Chaos about why he wants to help her. He didn't reply to her. He
    just said: &quot; We should move faster, I can sense several magical
    auras nearby. Hopefully they didn't target us. &quot; Then he
    continued to focus on the road. Nora is shocked and replies : &quot;
    How do we escape from them searching? Can't you use any magic to
    dispel those trackers or.. &quot; She did not even finish the
    sentence then Chaos started to speed up the horse speed by hitting
    it. &quot; Hold tight, my lady. &quot; he said. It Seemed like the
    enemy was tracking them and started to chase. Nora is scared and
    holds tight around Chaos' waist, she is scared of the <i>old thing</i>
    coming to chase her. Chaos feels something is chasing up to them, his
    katana is ready to slice. They are still in the middle of the way
    going to the Magical School, there is a dark forest nearby and should
    be safe if they go inside from hiding from the enemy chasing. Chaos
    decided to go into the forest for hiding, Nora still holding tight
    behind. After they go into the forest, enemies are shown out and stay
    outside the forest. There are 5 men as a group for hunting Chaos as
    bounty. One of them is planning to separate chase because the dark
    forest is very dangerous and any mistake made will be killed. All of
    them go into the forest and become shadows…</p>
<p lang="en" class="western" style="line-height: 130%; margin-left: 0in; margin-top: 0.14in; margin-bottom: 0in">
    *<i>Dark forest origin from the land of hell, before it was named as
        dark forest there is some case that happened. There was a big group
        of mages coming to the land of hell to search for clues for the
        forbidden ancient magic. There is one of them making a big mistake by
        summoning souls to seek through the wall and activate the traps by
        sealing all people's magic and random curses surrounding. Then
        several monsters will spawn around by the traps and start killing.
        Also there are many hidden traps and ancient magic seals inside the
        lands. Once traps are active, it will change the landscape to become
        more hidden. Therefore as you can see it changed the entire landscape
        from some hills covering surrounding ground becoming hills and forest
        form. As years pass soon it becomes a dark forest. *</i>
</p>
<p lang="en" class="western" style="line-height: 130%; margin-left: 0in; margin-top: 0.14in; margin-bottom: 0in">
    After Chaos and Nora go inside the forest, the horse runs away from
    the forest because it can sense the danger in the forest. Nora uses
    her magic sense to the surrounding area to check if there is any
    monster or enemy nearby. Her magic aura is not so strong, only can
    sense 500m surrounding her. *<i>She feeling so embarrassed for being
        weak*</i> Chaos detects her magic flow and tries to praise her for
    not being so sad. He even tries to give a thumbs up for her being
    good already for now. Nora is even more embarrassed because she
    doesn't know what to reply and her face is very red. * <i>In Nora
        inner mind she is feeling fully dead by now *</i> Chaos notices that
    her face is very red and tries to calm her down. Nora sees Chaos
    coming closer to her and her heartbeat is more raising, mostly
    wanting to explode. She tries to calm herself down by using some
    relaxing magic heal on herself. After some seconds pass, Chaos
    detects something is moving nearby and closer to the place they hide.
    The katana is ready anytime for anything coming around to them. His
    sharp eyes notice something jumping around in the front grass of
    them. Nora asks about something nearby, Chaos replies to her: &quot;
    I think it is an animal in the front grass pile of us, probably a
    small animal. &quot; She slowly sticks her head out to check the
    grass pile. There is something running out from the grass pile. A
    cute snowy fox jumping out from the grass and running towards Nora.
    She is shocked and excited about touching the foxy. The fox wasn't
    scared about Nora and let her touch its fur and body. Nora is
    enjoying patting the snowy fox while Chaos beside is concentrating on
    defending if anything comes nearby. She says: &quot; This snowy fox
    is so cute~ Can we keep it? &quot; Chaos thinks for a little while
    and replies to her: &quot; If you like it then keep it as your pet,
    maybe it will help you when you are in danger. &quot; She is so happy
    and continues playing with her new pet. &quot; What should we name
    it? Let me think… How about calling it Daisy? I like the name~ &quot;
    she said. Chaos nodded and at Daisy for a while, he can feel some
    magic flow from the little fox and he believes it can protect her
    when it's growing up. Nora has a deep thinking about her future and
    saving her sister, she says: &quot; Can I follow you for the next
    move? I don't want to lose anything again from my side… Please, I
    beg you, don't leave me behind… &quot; while having some tears come
    out from her eyes. Her words stunned Chaos for a while because she is
    serious about her next move. &quot; I don't mind if you want to
    follow me for the entire time but you may want to know about the
    danger surrounding me. Sigh.. I will tell you the truth. Actually I'm
    getting wanted by the world for a bounty. If you don't mind getting
    wanted, you can join me for the journey. &quot; he said and continued
    to stay guard. Nora accepts the invitation from Chaos. &quot; Look
    like they all move into the deepside of the forest, there is no sense
    of magic aura nearby. Let's move out from the forest. &quot; he said
    and held Nora's hand moving out to the forest. Nora is so embarrassed
    and she can't hide it because her other hand is helding Daisy. Daisy
    looks at her and smiles to let her calm.</p>
<p lang="en" class="western" style="line-height: 130%; margin-left: 0in; margin-top: 0.14in; margin-bottom: 0in">
    After several turns in the forest, Chaos and Nora finally walk out
    from the dark forest and back to the track for going to Magical
    School. Chaos lets Nora's hand go because her face is turning so red.
    Daisy is howling and yawning then tries to sleep in Nora's hugs. The
    cuteness makes Nora can't handle it anymore and starts slowly patting
    Daisy for making it sleep. Chaos swings his hand and starts a
    summoning aura for a mount. He summons a dragon and it is ready to
    fly. He asks Nora to join for the ride or choose to walk to the
    school. She instantly rejects walking to the school and starts to
    scold Chaos for bullying her. He said &quot; Haha don't be so angry
    my lady, wanna me lend a hand on helping you get up to the dragon? &quot;
    Then she replied: &quot; Yes please my.. &quot; *<i>she embarrassed
        till dead when try to say out the words* </i>Chaos pulling her up to
    the dragon and flying off to the sky. They are having fun in the sky
    because no enemy can chase up the speed of the dragon. While on the
    way to the school, Nora asks Chaos: &quot; How do I become stronger?
    I need more powerful magic to save my sister.. Please, tell me or
    teach me any of that magic.. I really need it… &quot; she said with
    a soft sound. Chaos didn't reply to her and continued to focus on
    flying the dragon to their destination. After some flies, Chaos can
    see the castle looking building over the sky to the ground. Nora is
    excited about the school and what she will do there. Before landing
    in the Astral High School, there were several security systems for
    it. They have a lot of air force protection and magical shields
    because they need to protect from all area monster attacks and other
    school attacks. Chaos and Nora didn't want to activate those defense
    systems and they landed outside the school. After landing, Chaos
    tells the dragon,aka Erino to stay inside the cave that is located
    nearby to the school. Erino nodded and flew there. Chaos is holding
    Nora's hand and walks toward the school. *<i>Nora feels blushed and
        wanna mine a hole and jump into it.</i>* Chaos looks at her red face
    and tries to tease her by pulling her near him and doing a &quot;princess
    hug&quot;. Nora's face is more red than before and she is very
    embarrassed. She tries to punch Chao because of the move he does.
    Chaos has some laughs on her and puts her down. *I wonder what she
    thinks* Nora blushes too much and doesn't want to talk to Chaos. He
    says: &quot; Let's move on to the Astral High School and have your
    first registration there as a student.&quot; She laughs and says: &quot;
    Yes, I will. Are you also a student here? &quot; Chaos reply: &quot;
    I did before but after some incident happened and I'm not a student
    at this school now. You can call me ‘senpai’ and I appreciate
    that. &quot; She thinks for a while and nods her head.
</p>
<p lang="en" class="western" style="line-height: 130%; margin-left: 0in; margin-top: 0.14in; margin-bottom: 0in">
    After they reach the school gate, they are held by the guards for
    showing them the ID card or Student Pass. Nora doesn't have any of
    those because she is coming from a small village not a town. She was
    very scared when the guards went near her. Chaos spoke: &quot; Let
    her pass with me, she is attending the student registration. &quot;
    The guards discuss for a while and let them pass to the school. Nora
    was very nervous and asked Chaos how they can pass the guards without
    any document or pass. Chaos replied: &quot; Don't worry my girl, you
    should be able to pass the security with me even if you didn't have
    any documents with you. If they want to hold you down, they don't
    dare to do it. <i>*hahaha he laugh*</i> You can trust me, I won't do
    anything bad to you or hurt you. &quot; When Nora heard what Chaos
    said, she was a little happy and she blushed again. They are walking
    toward the middle of the school. Nora asks: &quot; Where do we go
    now? &quot; He replies: &quot; The Student Council, where you can
    have your registration. Oh… I hope that Sakuya wasn't there. &quot;
    Nora is having a big ‘question mark’ for what will happen next
    and why senpai said that. After they walk awhile they meet a mystery
    guy who is dressed entirely in black cloth and trousers. The guy
    didn't want to join other people, he only liked to be lonely. Nora
    tries to speak with him and shock and try to use magic to attack her.
    Luckily he stopped the attack, and apologized for the trouble he
    made. Nora didn't hate him and accepted his apology. She said: &quot;
    What is your name? Why are you seperate from other students and try
    to not get near them? &quot; The guy replies: &quot; uh.. A girl
    attempts to have a conversation with me? No,it's my imagination. Yes,
    it's my imagination. There is no such a beautiful girl like that who
    will talk with me. &quot; Nora heard what he said and was shocked,
    for the first time people saying she is a beauty. She touches the guy
    and says: &quot; I'm here chatting with you, don't worry I won't hurt
    you.. My name is Nora, how about your name? We can be friends and
    learn magic together. &quot; The guy replies: &quot; uh…. erm…
    khem- my name is Alif, I'm the guy who loses his mind when learning
    too much magic power… Nice to meet you too, Nora. Such a nice name
    for a girl, perhaps you are my girlfriend.. haha… &quot; Nora's
    face turned red instantly after Alif said she was his girlfriend.
    Alif laughs for a while and he stops laughing because of some
    instantly dead aura nearby. It's like something is watching them from
    another place. Chaos notices something is nearby, it's a living
    organism because it can detect its heartbeat when using magic detect
    skill. Alif also uses his magic sense to detect and he locks on
    something that is at the very end of the hallways and rushes to it.
    Chaos lead Nora's hand and follow up Alif movement to the end of the
    hallways. When they reach there, there is a classroom door that isn't
    fully closed and there is some light inside. *<i>weak lights only,
        not so bright. Only like someone using a table lamp.</i>* They push
    the door open and notice someone quickly hiding under the front
    table. Alif didn't care about who it was and went to that table. When
    he bend down and he know he's fucked. A girl quickly grabs his head
    and smashes it into the ground. He choked and realized she was his
    wife, Fuuka. Fuuka is also shocked, she immediately comes out and
    pulls Alif up from the ground. She says sorry to Alif for the
    incident. He wasn't angry about that, he was just getting up and
    cleaning his clothes and trousers. After that he patted Fuuka's head
    and said: &quot; Next time don't do that again.. It's a little bit
    painful. '' Fuuka enjoyed the patting and nodded her head. Nora was
    shocked after seeing that happen. Fuuka notices that there were 2
    other people standing at the front door of the classroom. She invites
    them to join inside and have some self introduction. She started
    first: &quot; I'm Fuuka, head of the student council disciplinary
    officer. Also I'm not an ordinary girl, I love to cook delicious food
    such as fried rice, curry, omelet, udon, and ramen. Alif is my
    husband, I wish he will love me~ &quot; After her self introduction
    she pulls Alif's cloth and tells him it's his turn. Alif scratched
    his head and continued his self introduction: &quot; I'm Alif, the
    greatest mage ever in the school. I love to see Fuuka cook food for
    me and it tastes very good. &quot; *<i>In Alif's mind is thinking
        about Fuuka's breast are so soft and bouncy, her body is perfection</i>*
    Fuuka blushes after he says that. Nora says: &quot; It's my turn
    right?~ I'm Nora, currently I don't have anything. I like to eat
    curry with rice. I'm going to get my registration as a student in
    this school after our self introduction~ &quot; <i>*Nora look at
        Chaos and smiling*</i> The classroom went silent for a while and
    everyone looked at Chaos. Chaos looks around and says: &quot; Me? &quot;
    Everyone nodded their heads. He slightly shakes his head and says: &quot;
    uh.. I'm Chaos, just an ordinary person. Not really good at anything
    but will take care of people who need the help. &quot; Fuuka says: &quot;
    Ordinary person…? &quot; Nora replied to her: &quot; It's not, he
    saved me from those bad guys when in my village. Also he treats me
    good food~ &quot; *<i>Nora still in the state of enjoying that
        delicious food at the food stall before they move to Astral High
        School*</i> Fuuka looks at her face smiling and a little drool
    showing out, immediately pulling out a stove from nowhere and
    starting to cook some food. Daisy's head pops out from Nora's jacket
    after smelling some good aroma. After 5 minutes have passed, Fuuka
    finishes her cooking and has a table of delicious food that hooks
    Nora's eye onto it. Nora asks: &quot; Can we eat the food? &quot;
    Fuuka nods her head and invites them to join. Everyone is enjoying
    the meals except Chaos. Daisy is having its own meals, a piece of
    delicious cooked porkchop which Nora gives to it. After enjoying the
    meals, Nora needs to go to the student union for her registration.
    She wasted a lot of time here. She immediately picks up her package
    and walks to the front door. Chaos says: &quot; Finish the delicious
    meals already, my lady? It's almost late afternoon already, soon
    every student will finish school and you will miss your registration
    today. &quot; Nora blushes and punches Chaos in the tummy. She says:
    &quot; Senpai,why didn't you tell me about that! &quot; Chaos endured
    the pain from his tummy and said: &quot; My lady… It's like you're
    having fun with them and I don't want to interrupt your fun.. &quot;
    *<i>Nora have nothing to say with it</i>* Fuuka says: &quot;
    Nora-chan you want to go to the student council? I can go with you
    since I have some paperworks need handle to student council
    president. &quot; In the end all of them are going to the student
    council. After some chats they reach the student council. Fuuka
    knocks the door and inside the student council replies with a soft
    sound 'come in'. Fuuka opens the door and goes inside the student
    council. There is a girl sitting on the sofa in the middle of the
    room and waving with them. Her name is Yukino, Student Council
    Vice-President who helps to manage all the paperworks when the
    president is not there. Yukino notices Chaos and says: &quot; Senpai,
    what things take you here? Do you want to prepare anything else for
    surprising the president or taking new quest paperworks? &quot; Chaos
    replied: &quot; Nope,I just brought Nora to take registration for a
    student here. Also don't tell Sakuya about me coming here. Thanks a
    lot for helping.&quot; Yukino nods her head and takes the note. Nora
    asks: &quot; Who is Sakuya,senpai? &quot; He replied: &quot; Sakuya
    is the president of the Student Council. She is very sexy and I can't
    afford her to keep asking me where I go. &quot; *<i>Fuuka and Alif
        are laughing at behind</i>* Yukino says: &quot; Don't worry, senpai.
    Yukino will promise you didn't tell Sakuya about your visit here~ Oh
    also Nora-chan, you are coming here for the registration for students
    right? Can you give me your information letter and do some paperworks
    here. &quot; Nora handles all the information letters to Yukino.
    Yukino takes all the letters and starts to do her paperworks. After
    some moments pass, Yukino finishes Nora's registration and formally
    welcomes Nora to the Astral High School.</p>
