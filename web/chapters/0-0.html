    <a class="big">Once</a> upon a time, there were <b>two little girls</b> who loved to
    play together in a little
    town. <br /> <br />
</div>

<div class="story-content-hack">
    <b>They</b> always like to go into the forest to <b>play hide and
        seek.</b>

    Even with their parents scolding, they still like to go on adventures.
    <b>The town</b> they stay in is a small town but <b>army</b> patrols around the town for the citizens' safety.
    They like to talk with the army and want to know about the outside world of <b>the town</b>.
    <b>The army</b> also loves to chat with them because of the cuteness and kindness of the two little girls. <br />
    <a style="margin-left: 20px;">They</a> helped those troops when <b>the war</b> happened, which is <b>2 years ago</b>.
    <b>The War</b> between the human race and demon race.
    Demons are very selfish and brutal, like killing adults and catching those young children and females.
    <b>The war</b> started and ended last year. There was a brave knight who jumped out and sliced the demon lord's head off only by using 4 moves.
    The demons are afraid of the knight because their lord dies on him and they all run away into the forest of the darkness.

    <div class="story-middle">
        “Yeah, <i>that is the forest the little girl likes to go to.</i>”
    </div>

    Two little girls are using their hidden abilities for healing those injured troops after the wars ended.

    <div class="story-middle">
        “<i>That's why the army love to talk to both little girls.</i>”
    </div>

    <br />
    <hr class="story-hr">
    </hr>
    <br />

    <!-- Preface: 2nd -->
    <a class='big' style="margin-left: 20px;">After</a> several years, the forest has been a <b>FORBIDDEN</b> place ever since, but
    even after all of that, the two little girls <i>still</i> love to go there to <b>rest</b> and <b>play</b> hide and seek.
    The army gave them a <i>minor</i> warning to them but they still decide to go out because <u>they didn't like to</u> stay in the town. <br />
    <a style="margin-left: 20px;">They</a> didn't have much of a connection in the town, hence why, they feel very lonely, their parents barely talked to them because of their busy life and didn't care them enough. <br />
    <a style="margin-left: 20px">So</a> they don't care about what their parents will think about them and go outside of the town.
    They have a “<i>secret ability</i>” that can make themselves safe in the forest.

    <!-- Preface: 3rd -->
    <div class="story-middle">
        “Let's introduce the two little girls shall we?”
    </div>

    <!-- Intro: 1st -->
    <a class='big' style="margin-left: 20px;">They</a> are siblings, <b>Tamoe</b> and <b>Nora</b>.
    Tamoe is the younger sister, and Nora is the older sister. <br />
    <a style="margin-left: 20px;">Nora</a> is 12 years old.
    Nora has a pair of sky blue colored eyes, light blue long hair.
    She loves to wear a gray shirt with a navy blue skirt.
    Nora is a brave girl, she likes to go outside adventures even her parents do not allow her.
    She always smiles even when she is sad and not showing it to others. <br />
    <a style="margin-left: 20px;">While</a> on the other side her younger sister, Tamoe, who is younger than her 2 years old. <br />

    Nora and Tamoe are not related by blood, Tamoe lost her parents when she was 6. Her parents died to the Big Ancient War* when she is 4. <br />
    <a style="margin-left: 20px;">She</a> has an older brother who took care of her when her parents died, but he died in an unfortunate accident while helping Tamoe doing groceries. <br />
    She was only 6 years old at the time, she got picked up by Nora's parents when she is in the town buying ice cream but did not have <i>any</i> money to pay it with.

    <div class="story-middle">
        So this is how Nora and Tamoe meet up and are siblings together.
    </div>

    <a style="margin-left: 20px;">Tamoe</a> has a pair of light gray colored eyes, sky blue colored long hair. <br />
    She loves to wear a gray dress.
    Tamoe is a bit timid, because of that her unrelated sister, Nora, loves to bring her go outside of the town to reach the outside world.
    Outside world is much prettier than the town where they stay.

    <div class="story-middle">
        <!-- Reference: Just once an incident happened, Tamoe and Nora got separated. -->
        But then, out of nowhere, it happened—
    </div>

    —a rift, a magical rift, very powerful one at that, appeared in the middle of the forest, while they were playing hide and seek. <br />
    <a style="margin-left: 20px;;">The</a> magic waves, which is released by the rift, are affecting them even though they have hidden magical protection but it was clearly not enough.
    The over-powering waves made them very dizzy and gave them an awful nausea, almost faint even. <br />
    Nora promises that she will not leave Tamoe alone in this forest, she will carry Tamoe out of the forest even though her body is in bad condition.
    Tamoe keeps her promise with Nora but she thinks she can't make it because the wave is stronger than before. <br />
    <a style="margin-left: 20px;">Her</a> body reached the limit because of that she can't move, she doesn't want the others to also get slowed down by her. <br />
    Tamoe, then, uses her last few bits of magic power to push Nora out of the forest and promise her not to come back to this forest until she became stronger.

    <div class="story-middle">
        <!-- Reference: Nora is crying with her tears out and screams her younger sister's name but nothing replying back. -->
        Nora cried her eyes out while screaming for her younger sister, but nobody came.
    </div>

    <div class="story-middle">
        Tamoe are now lost in the darkness.
